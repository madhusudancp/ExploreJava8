Concurrency is the ability to do more than one thing at the same time.
Softwares that are able to do more than one thing at a time are called concurrent software.

Concurrency is a very broad term, and it can be used at various levels. For example -

Multiprocessing - Multiple Processors/CPUs executing concurrently. The unit of concurrency here, is a CPU.
Multitasking - Multiple tasks/processes running concurrently on a single CPU. The operating system executes these tasks by switching between them very frequently. The unit of concurrency, in this case, is a Process.
Multithreading - Multiple parts of the same program running concurrently. In this case, we go a step further and divide the same program into multiple parts/threads and run those threads concurrently.
